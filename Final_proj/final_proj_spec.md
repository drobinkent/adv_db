Final Project
Using Mongo (on any available platform), load the restaurant collection, zip code collection, and one other data set of your choice. With these three collections, design a report using Mongo that tells us something interesting that we could not have learned from any one or two of these sources of data. 


This is an exercise in understanding connections between datasets and using aggregate pipelines and lookups in Mongo to explore those connections. 


Submit your results, including descriptions of the collections, queries, and results, in *ONE* PDF file.
